      <h2>Sciences</h2>
      <p>
        Science is the explination of everything in the universe. Different sciences explain
        different information about the universe. These sciences are seperated into the many branches of science.
      </p>
      <h2>The Branches of SCIENCE</h2>
      <p>
        There are many branches of science but first you must learn about the three main sciences.
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="s">Physical Science:</span> deals with matter and energy and allows us to describe.
            them.
          <li><span class="s">Earth Science:</span> explains the Earth, its atmosphere, and the solar system to which it belongs.
          <li><span class="s">Life Science:</span> discribes living organisms thier internal processes and there relationship
            to each other in the enviroment.
        </ul>
      <p>
        As I said these three sciences are seperated into the many branches of science.
